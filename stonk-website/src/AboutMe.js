                        <p>Hello there! I created this website to help organize my records and thoughts 
                            in the financial markets. It serves as a portfolio of my work and an extension 
                            of my memory. Before blogging, I have previously kept records on spreadsheets 
                            and documents. In July 2022, I launched my first website using the drag and drop 
                            tools from Wordpress. I eventually thought the interface was too limited, so I've 
                            built my own website from scratch! Gone are the cluttered links to spreadsheets
                            and word documents!
                        </p>
                        <p> My long-term trading agenda is to combine algorithmic strategies with research 
                            to generate returns that outpace the benchmarks. Although I am contrarian in nature, 
                            I interpret financial markets through multiple broad lenses. I have strong knowledge 
                            of fundamentals, technicals, economics, portfolio theory, and algorithmic trading.  
                            I'm a huge fan of technology, fintech, blockchain, renewable energy, and 
                            disruptive innovation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Please do not hesitate to reach out to me with feedback, comments, inquiries, 
                            opportunities, or just to say hi! I am updating my site on a daily basis and 
                            will respond to all messages.

                                <p>I first started to track stocks after glancing at one of the watchlists of my 
                                    parents. The stocks I followed included HAL, GM, ATPG, BA, & PSUN. ATPG went 
                                    bankrupt later in 2012, and PSUN was not a publicly traded ticker anymore
                                    when I followed up in 2015.

                                <p>At the mall, I would go to the Apple store and use their i-pad samples to
                                    check stocks. I loved the grid display, in which larger companies had bigger
                                    squares and bigger changes would have more color intensity.

                                    interest to start paper trading on Stockfuse. Despite having no trading
                                    strategy, I generated an 8% return from around May-June 2016 before 
                                    I was locked out of the account.

                                    book: "Come Into My Trading Room" by Alexander Elder. I finished it in

                                    efficient progress.

                                    advice of Elder, I built my own watchlist and started applying 
                                    indicator and pattern-recognition techniques.

                                <p>With the COVID-19 recession and stock market plummet, I committed myself
                                    to trading and started recording actual paper trades based on technical 
                                    analysis. From March to August, I experimented with many moving averages
                                    and bottom-pane indicators. My indicators have largely remained unchanged
                                    since August 2020, although my strategy has always been evolving.

                                    management, and I started monitoring the markets on a daily basis. 
                                    In July 2020, I also opened an Interactive Brokers paper account, which I 
                                    reset to $10,000 in August for more realistic monetary numbers. In August 
                                    2020, I closed out my initial Investopedia account and turned my focus 
                                    solely to Interactive Brokers.

                                    accounts, I produced a year-end return of 38.54% (from June 2020).

                                    paper notes of my watchlist on a daily basis. I was experiencing 
                                    significant self-esteem and emotional health issues, so most of my efforts

                                    made trading more frequent. I started focusing more on porfolio composition

                                    Robert Shiller, a bunch of Fintech courses, an options securities course,

                                    My first approach was to design a chart of QQQ, which I struggled with. My 
                                    programming skills were rusty, so I turned my focus to economics. I became
                                    obsessed with the Federal Reserve. Inflation and other economic concerns 
                                    brought my attention to the broader financial markets, where I developed
                                    strong foundations in.

                                    and designed a "Master List" spreadsheet of over 560 stocks categorized 
                                    by sector, which I used as a dataset for future projects. I also learned

                                <p>I launched my first Website, <i>Dark Horse of Wall Street</i> ,
                                using Wordpress. No coding was involved, but I moved my records into the blog
                                and worked on its features for the remainder of the year. 
                                </p>

                                <h1>August 2022</h1>
                                <p>I began developing a screener project in Python to help analyze patterns for
                                    hundreds of stocks. I experimented with many setups before completing it in 
                                    December 2022. The screener utilizes the Master List database I finished in 
                                    July and sifts through the 560+ stocks in minutes. 
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div className='TimelineContent'>
                                <h1>December 2022</h1>
                                <p>During the waning days of 2022, I worked hard to incorporate both my screener
                                    and individual knowledge to create a new system for sustainable trading. 
                                    As the culmination of achivements in a wildly productive year, I created 
                                    a stock evaluation system that allows me to manually track around 120 
                                    stocks on a rotating basis. The screener analyzes the other stocks 
                                    (excluding Materials and Utilities since I do not track the sectors) and 
                                    spits out tickers that I can manually confirm and put orders in.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div className='TimelineContent'>
                                <h1>December 2022</h1>
                                <p>Regrettably, I finished the year with a -50.47% return on my TD Ameritrade 
                                    account, and I ended with a -31.41% return on my Interactive Brokers paper 
                                    account. However, I believe the struggles of 2022 helped build the 
                                    foundations for future success.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h1>January 2023</h1>
                                <p>After a few days of experimentation, I settled into my new trading system and
                                    created a program to write the screener results into a daily pdf report (it
                                    was previously printed in the console). I also began working on a new and
                                    improved website to store my records and share my journey!
                                </p>

                                <p>I hopefully will be able to launch the second website of  
                                    <i> Dark Horse of Wall Street</i>!
